# Memento 

A single-file browser app for managing a local JSON knowledge base with Claude memory sync support. Works in Chrome and Edge using the File System Access API.

## Getting started

1. Open `memento.html` in **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** (other browsers don't support the File System Access API).
2. Click **Connect folder** and select your `knowledge-base/` directory (entries are stored as individual files in `entries/`).
3. The app remembers your file handle between sessions via IndexedDB, so next time it will reconnect automatically.

## Bulk actions

Select several cards and act on all of them at once:

- **Shift-click** any card to select it (desktop), or turn on **Select** in the control bar
  (also the `M` key) so plain clicks/taps select — the touch path. Selected cards wear a blue
  ring.
- A floating bar appears while anything is selected: **Pin / Archive / Tag… / Delete**, plus
  the count. Pin and Archive act toward the shared state — if every selected card is already
  pinned, the button reads Unpin (so bulk-unarchiving from the Archived scope just works).
- **Tag…** opens the tag pop-up in bulk flavor: chips on *every* selected card remove on tap;
  available chips add to all.
- **Delete** confirms once with the count. **Esc** puts the selection (and Select mode) away.

## Desktop app (macOS)

memento can run as its own standalone app — a chromeless window with its own Dock icon —
by installing it as a Chrome PWA. Chrome only installs from a secure origin (not `file://`),
so a launchd agent serves the repo locally:

- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kmt.memento-serve.plist` runs
  `python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /Users/kmt/memento` at login
  (localhost-only; the knowledge base is never exposed to the network). Load it once with
  `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kmt.memento-serve.plist`.
- **Install once:** open `http://localhost:8765/memento.html` in Chrome and click the install
  icon in the address bar (or ⋮ → Save and share → Install page as app). Chrome creates
  `Memento.app` under `~/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized/` with the icon from
  `manifest.webmanifest` / `icons/` — pin it to the Dock.
- `./memento.sh` also launches it (starts the server if launchd isn't running it, opens the
  installed app, falls back to a plain `--app` window when not yet installed).

**Port 8765 is the app's storage origin** (PAT, folder permission, caches all key on it) —
never change it once installed. And because `http://localhost:8765` is a different origin
from `file://`, the first launch starts with empty browser storage: re-enter the GitHub PAT
(if you use it on desktop), re-connect the knowledge-base folder, and the INDRA/layout caches
rebuild themselves. The cards and git repo are untouched, and the old `file://` way of opening
memento keeps working unchanged. Installed PWAs get *persistent* folder permissions in Chrome,
so the folder re-prompt should appear less often than on `file://`.

## Card types

Each entry has a type, shown as an icon on the card:

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Fact | ☐✓ | Verified information |
| Reference | ❞ | Citations, papers, clippings |
| Observation | 👁 | Things noticed or seen |
| Hypothesis | 🧩 | Testable conjectures |
| Idea | 💡 | Open-ended thoughts |
| Note | 📄 | General notes (default for new cards) |
| Person | 👤 | Collaborators and contacts |
| GitHub | 🐙 | Synced from GitHub repos (read-only) |

## Adding and editing entries

Press the **+ Add** button (or **Cmd+N** / **Ctrl+N**) to create a new entry. Each entry has:

- **Type** — select from the type picker
- **Title** — a short heading for the card
- **Content** — the main body text (Markdown with LaTeX math via KaTeX)
- **Tags** — comma-separated labels for categorisation
- **Genes** — comma-separated gene names (displayed as chips, searchable with `@` syntax)
- **Source** — an optional reference or URL
- **Due date** — optional deadline (shown with color-coded urgency on the card)

Press **Save** (or **Cmd+Enter**) to save. The entry is written to your local JSON file immediately.

Click any card to expand it and see the full content. Click the title to edit (or the ✎ button when expanded). Use the ✕ button to delete.

## Card preview modes

A three-state toggle in the toolbar controls how much detail cards show when collapsed:

1. **Minimal** — titles only (default)
2. **Compact** — titles + tags and genes
3. **Full** — titles + tags/genes + body preview

## Searching

Type in the search bar to filter entries. Press **Escape** to clear the search.

| Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| free text | matches title, content, tags, genes, source | `tau protein` |
| `#tag` | filter by tag | `#neurodegeneration` |
| `#tag1,tag2` | OR across tags | `#review,todo` |
| `@GENE` | filter by gene | `@MAPT` |
| `@GENE1,GENE2` | OR across genes | `@MAPT,HDAC6` |
| space between tokens | AND (all must match) | `@MAPT #tau` |
| ` , ` (comma flanked by spaces) | OR between groups | `#review tau , #brain amyloid` |

**Examples:**

- `@MAPT @HDAC6` — entries mentioning **both** MAPT and HDAC6
- `@MAPT,HDAC6` — entries mentioning **either** MAPT or HDAC6
- `#review tau , #brain amyloid` — entries tagged "review" containing "tau", **or** entries tagged "brain" containing "amyloid"

Tags and genes support prefix matching, so `@MAP` matches `@MAPT`, `@MAP2K1`, etc.

### Pinning individual cards

**⌥ (Alt) click** any card to pin it — it shows as a chip below the search bar and stays visible
no matter what the search text, tags, type, or archive filter would otherwise hide, the same way
`*GENE` overrides the Genes view's filters. Click the chip (or Alt-click the card again) to unpin
it. Useful for "show me #Drive, plus this one other card I want next to it" without loosening the
filter itself. Pinned cards are saved as part of a **saved view**, same as highlighted genes.

## Sorting

The sidebar **Sort** section offers:

| Sort | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Modified** | By modification date (default, newest first). People cards always sort last. |
| **Due** | By due date. Cards without a due date sink to the bottom. |
| **Synced** | By sync status (unsynced first). |
| **Type** | Alphabetically by entry type. |
| **Tags** | By most common tag per card. |
| **Connection** | Connections first. |

Click any sort option again to reverse direction.

## Filtering

The sidebar provides several filter sections:

- **Type** — click a type to show only matching cards
- **Tags** — click a tag to filter (tags show entry counts)
- **Connections** — cycle through: all → connections only → connections excluded
- **Archive** — toggle between active and archived cards

## Due dates

Cards can have an optional due date. The card border changes color based on urgency:

- **Red** — overdue
- **Red (brighter)** — due today
- **Muted red** — due within a few days

## Archive

Click the archive icon (📦) on any card to archive it. Archived cards are hidden by default. Use the archive filter in the sidebar to view them. Unarchiving the last archived card automatically switches back to the active view.

## Connections

Flag any card as a "connection" to mark relationships between entries. The connection icon appears on flagged cards. Use the sidebar connection filter to show only connections or exclude them.

## Link mode

Click the link button to enter link mode. Then click any card to insert a `[[id|title]]` reference at the cursor in the edit form. These references render as clickable links in expanded cards.

## Highlight genes

Toggle the gene highlight bar to enter gene names. Matching genes are shown in accent color with bold weight across all cards, and cards with the most matches sort to the top.

## GitHub integration

1. Click the GitHub icon in the bottom-left sidebar and enter a Personal Access Token (stored in localStorage).
2. Click the sync button (↻) to fetch all your repos. This also fetches the latest issue date for repos with open issues.
3. GitHub cards are **read-only** — clicking the title opens the issues view instead of edit mode.
4. Expanding a GitHub card lazy-loads the README and updates the card's modification time from the latest issue.
5. Card modification time uses `pushed_at` (last commit), updated by the latest issue date when available.

## Images

Drag and drop images onto a card while editing, or **paste** one straight from the clipboard
(⌘V) — a screenshot goes in without ever touching a file. Both write the image into the
`images/` folder and drop a markdown `![…](images/…)` reference into the card body:

- **Editor open** — the reference is spliced in at the caret of the Content field (appended to the
  end if the field isn't focused). Nothing is written to the card until you Save.
- **Editor closed** — the image is appended to the **expanded** card and saved immediately.
- Anywhere else — no card open, or the caret in the search box — the paste is left to the browser.

Images need a connected folder (or the GitHub backend, where the image is committed alongside the
card in one commit). Image markdown is stripped during Claude sync since local images aren't
accessible to Claude.

## Web clipper bookmarklet

Clip selected text from any web page directly into the knowledge base.

### Setup

Create a new bookmark in Chrome/Edge and paste the following as the URL:

```
javascript:void(function(){var sel=window.getSelection();var s=sel.toString().trim();var h='';try{if(sel.rangeCount){var d=document.createElement('div');d.appendChild(sel.getRangeAt(0).cloneContents());h=d.innerHTML}}catch(e){}var c=JSON.stringify({_kb_clip:true,content:s||'',html:h||'',source:location.href,title:document.title});navigator.clipboard.writeText(c).then(function(){var b=document.createElement('div');b.textContent='Clipped to KB!';b.style.cssText='position:fixed;top:20px;right:20px;background:#333;color:#fff;padding:8px 16px;border-radius:6px;z-index:999999;font:14px sans-serif';document.body.appendChild(b);setTimeout(function(){b.remove()},1500)})})()
```

### Usage

1. Highlight text on any web page.
2. Click the "Clip to KB" bookmark. A brief "Clipped to KB!" toast confirms the copy.
3. Switch to the knowledge base tab.
4. Press **Cmd+V** (or **Ctrl+V**). The add form opens pre-filled as a Reference with content block-quoted, source URL, and title.

Note: the paste shortcut only triggers the clip import when no input field is focused.

## Syncing with Claude's memory

Each entry has a sync status icon: green (synced) or red (unsynced). Editing marks the entry as unsynced.

Three sync actions:

1. **Per-entry sync** — click the sync icon on a card to copy a prompt for that single entry to your clipboard. Paste into Claude to update its memory.
2. **Sync all** — copies a full-replace prompt covering all entries.
3. **Cleanup** — copies a prompt listing entry IDs, asking Claude to delete memory entries that no longer exist locally.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Cmd+N** / **Ctrl+N** | Open the Add Entry form |
| **Cmd+Enter** / **Ctrl+Enter** | Save current entry |
| **Cmd+V** / **Ctrl+V** | Import clip (when no input focused) |
| **Escape** | Cancel edit or clear search |

## File format

Each entry is stored as a pair of files in `knowledge-base/entries/`:

- `{id}.json` — metadata (all fields except content)
- `{id}.md` — the content body (Markdown)

Example `{id}.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "type": "fact",
  "title": "Entry title",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "genes": ["MAPT", "HDAC6"],
  "source": "https://example.com",
  "date": "2026-03-28T12:00:00.000Z",
  "synced": true,
  "connection": false,
  "archived": false,
  "due": "2026-04-10"
}
```

The companion `{id}.md` contains the Markdown content. For `_digest` entries, the `.md` file contains the digest markdown.

A legacy single-file format (`knowledge-base.json`, a flat JSON array) is also present but no longer used by the CLI tools.

Valid types: `fact`, `reference`, `observation`, `hypothesis`, `idea`, `note`, `people`, `github`.

## Command-line tool (kb-manage.py)

`kb-manage.py` is a Python CLI for batch operations on the knowledge base. It operates on the knowledge-base directory (not a single JSON file). Requires the `click` library (`pip install click`).

```
python3 kb-manage.py COMMAND KB_DIR [ARGS] [OPTIONS]
```

### Tags

```bash
kb-manage.py list-tags knowledge-base/                        # list all tags with counts
kb-manage.py list-tags knowledge-base/ --sort name             # sort alphabetically
kb-manage.py rename-tag knowledge-base/ "old-name" "new-name"  # rename across all entries
kb-manage.py delete-tag knowledge-base/ "unwanted"             # remove from all entries
kb-manage.py add-tag knowledge-base/ "new-tag"                 # add to all entries
kb-manage.py add-tag knowledge-base/ "reviewed" --where-type fact   # add only to facts
kb-manage.py add-tag knowledge-base/ "tau" --where-gene MAPT        # add where gene matches
```

### Genes

```bash
kb-manage.py list-genes knowledge-base/                        # list all genes with counts
kb-manage.py rename-gene knowledge-base/ "HDAC6" "HDAC6A"     # rename (case-insensitive match)
kb-manage.py delete-gene knowledge-base/ "BRCA1"               # remove from all entries
```

### Types

```bash
kb-manage.py list-types knowledge-base/                        # list types with counts
kb-manage.py rename-type knowledge-base/ "quote" "quote_para"  # rename a type
kb-manage.py set-type knowledge-base/ hypothesis --where-tag speculative  # bulk change type
```

### Removing entries

All removal commands support `--dry-run` to preview without modifying the file.

```bash
kb-manage.py remove-by-tag knowledge-base/ "deprecated" --dry-run  # preview
kb-manage.py remove-by-tag knowledge-base/ "deprecated"            # remove for real
kb-manage.py remove-by-type knowledge-base/ "person"               # remove all of a type
kb-manage.py remove-by-id knowledge-base/ abc123 def456            # remove specific entries
```

### Search and replace

```bash
kb-manage.py grep knowledge-base/ "MAPT" -i                    # search (case-insensitive)
kb-manage.py grep knowledge-base/ "tau" --field content         # search specific field
kb-manage.py replace knowledge-base/ "BDMI" "BDM incompatibility"          # literal replace
kb-manage.py replace knowledge-base/ "chr(\d+)" "chromosome \1" --regex    # regex replace
kb-manage.py replace knowledge-base/ "old text" "new text" --dry-run       # preview changes
```

### Merging and importing

```bash
kb-manage.py merge knowledge-base/ source-kb/               # merge by ID (skip duplicates)
kb-manage.py merge knowledge-base/ source-kb/ --overwrite   # merge (overwrite duplicates)
kb-manage.py import knowledge-base/ source-kb/              # append all (new IDs assigned)
```

### Bulk operations

```bash
kb-manage.py set-synced knowledge-base/ false                  # mark all as unsynced
kb-manage.py set-synced knowledge-base/ true --where-tag reviewed  # mark filtered as synced
kb-manage.py touch knowledge-base/                             # update all dates to now
kb-manage.py touch knowledge-base/ --where-tag active          # touch filtered entries
```

### Quality and diagnostics

```bash
kb-manage.py stats knowledge-base/       # summary: counts, types, tags, genes, content lengths
kb-manage.py validate knowledge-base/    # check for missing fields and unknown types
kb-manage.py clean knowledge-base/       # normalize: add missing fields, trim whitespace, dedup tags
kb-manage.py dedup knowledge-base/       # remove duplicates by title
kb-manage.py dedup knowledge-base/ --by content --dry-run  # preview content-based dedup
```

## Morning digest (kb-sync-and-digest.py)

`kb-sync-and-digest.py` fetches fresh GitHub activity (commits, issues) for all synced repos and generates a natural language "Where am I" digest using the Claude API. The digest is printed to the terminal and saved as a `_digest` entry in `entries/`, viewable in the web app via the "Where am I" toggle.

### Prerequisites

Two environment variables are required:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — a GitHub personal access token
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — an Anthropic API key

### Usage

```bash
# Full sync + digest (default: all activity)
pixi run digest

# Only activity from the last 7 days
pixi run python kb-sync-and-digest.py knowledge-base/ --days 7

# Sync GitHub data without generating a digest
pixi run python kb-sync-and-digest.py knowledge-base/ --sync-only

# Use a different Claude model
pixi run python kb-sync-and-digest.py knowledge-base/ --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### Daily cron job

To run the digest automatically every morning at 7:00, add a crontab entry:

```bash
crontab -e
```

```cron
0 7 * * * GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... cd /Users/kmt/memento && /Users/kmt/memento/.pixi/envs/default/bin/python kb-sync-and-digest.py knowledge-base/ --days 30 >> /tmp/kb-digest.log 2>&1
```

Replace `ghp_...` and `sk-ant-...` with your actual tokens. The digest will be available in the web app next time you open it.

## Digest only (kb-digest.py)

`kb-digest.py` generates a digest from existing GitHub activity data without re-syncing from GitHub. Useful when data has already been synced and you just want a fresh summary.

### Prerequisites

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — an Anthropic API key

### Usage

```bash
# Generate digest from existing data
pixi run python kb-digest.py knowledge-base/

# Only activity from the last 14 days
pixi run python kb-digest.py knowledge-base/ --days 14

# Use a different Claude model
pixi run python kb-digest.py knowledge-base/ --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

## Requirements

- Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge (File System Access API required)
- `kb-manage.py` requires Python 3 and `click`
- `kb-sync-and-digest.py` and `kb-digest.py` require Python 3, `click`, and `anthropic` (install via `pixi install`)
