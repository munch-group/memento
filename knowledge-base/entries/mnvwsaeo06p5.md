## Forward computation in steps:

- **accumulated_occupancy(...)** calls **accumulated_visits** for discrete  graphs, **accumulated_visiting_time** for continuous graphs
- **state_probability(t)**. The probability vector p(t) where p(t)[i] = probability of being in transient state i at time t (continuous) or after n jumps (discrete). 

## Graph elimination

- **expected_waiting_time(rewards)** Computes E[total accumulated reward before absorption] via graph elimination. With the default reward vector (all 1s), this gives E[T], the expected total time until absorption. The result is a vector of length n_vertices where result[0] (the starting vertex) holds the final answer. The other entries are intermediate quantities from the elimination. This is the workhorse behind moments(). Higher moments are computed by iterating reward transformations.
- **expected_sojourn_time()**. Computes E[time in state i before absorption] for every state, starting from the initial distribution. Implemented by running expected_waiting_time with n different unit reward vectors (one-hot for each state) in a single batched pass. So expected_sojourn_time()[i] = the expected total time the chain spends in state i over its entire lifetime. You can think of it as accumulated_occupancy for infinite t.
